Connections:
The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Module has 4 pins, Ground, VCC, Trig and Echo. The Ground and the VCC pins of the module needs to be connected to the Ground and the 5 volts pins on the Arduino Board respectively and the trig and echo pins to any Digital I/O pin on the Arduino Board.

The HC-SR04 sensor attach to the Breadboard
The Sensor VCC connect to the Arduino Board +5V
The Sensor GND connect to the Arduino Board GND
The Sensor Trig connect to the Arduino Board Digital I/O 9
The Sensor Echo connect to the Arduino Board Digital I/O 10

Buzzer and LED
The Buzzer attach to the Breadboard
The Buzzer long leg (+) connect to the Arduino Board Digital 11
The Buzzer short leg (-) connect to the Arduino Board GND
The LED attach to the Breadboard
The Resistor connect to the LED long leg (+)
The Resistor other leg (from LED’s long leg) connect to the Arduino Board Digital 13
The LED short leg (-) connect to the Arduino Board GND
